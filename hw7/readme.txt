i believe i should get 100% on this assignment.
It does exactly what it needed to do.

The way this works is that it uses the same function above it to print the child processes data
the child process prints itself

it uses the posix standard functions for fork, 
and exit to exit and create processes.
It also uses posix pipe, and posix getpid, getppid, 
getgid getegid, getuid geteuid to get all the process
info about each process
