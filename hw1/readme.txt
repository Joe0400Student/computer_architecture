I think its a 99% success (I did formatting to what I believe he wanted, HW documentation for output
is not fully described), as it is able to print accordingly to the terminal for any floating point
I used cout to print each member of the segmented memory structure inside the union. This makes it
print out the memory structure easily. I also made a function to space the binary correctly. I used 
bitset<n> to generate the bitstring for it. I also used std outputflags for the assignment.

I also created a function that will figure out how long the notation for a number is so that it 
can use scientific or fixed. Then it will format accordingly. This way it looks pretty as it prints
the output.
